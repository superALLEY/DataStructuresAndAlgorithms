## Introduction

This repository contains a series of exercises and implementations designed to solidify understanding of essential data structures and algorithms. These concepts are foundational for computer science students and developers alike.

## Array Operations

- Implementation of basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.
- Various algorithms demonstrating the use of arrays in problem-solving.

## Functions and Void Lists

- Examples of functions operating on data structures.
- Implementations of void lists, showcasing operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.

## Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked Lists**: Implementation and manipulation of linked lists, including insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Circular Linked Lists**: Understanding circular linked lists and their operations.

## Doubly Linked Lists

- Implementation of doubly linked lists, including forward and backward traversal.
- Advanced operations such as inserting and deleting nodes in different positions.

## Recursion

- Basic and advanced recursion examples.
- Solving problems using recursive techniques.

## Trees

- **Binary Trees**: Implementation and traversal techniques (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Binary Search Trees (BST)**: Insertion, deletion, and searching in BST.
- **Tree Traversal**: Level order traversal, height, and depth of trees.

## Stacks (Piles)

- Implementation of stacks using arrays and linked lists.
- Exercises on stack operations: push, pop, peek, and checking for stack overflow/underflow.

## Queues (Files)

- Implementation of queues using arrays and linked lists.
- Exercises on queue operations: enqueue, dequeue, front, rear, and circular queue implementation.
